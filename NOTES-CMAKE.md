Notes for CMake generator
===========================

Requirement details
-------------------

In addition to the obvious CMake requirement, these are required as well:

## Perl

We recommend Strawberry Perl, or alternatively ActiveState Perl on Windows.
Use the appropriate package manager for Unix systems to acquire Perl.

please see the [Notes for Windows platforms](NOTES-WINDOWS.md) or [Notes for Unix platforms](NOTES-UNIX.md).


## Windows 

### Netwide Assembler (NASM) on Windows

NASM is the only currently supported assembler on Windows. It is available from <https://www.nasm.us> and has great support with CMake.

Quick start
-----------

 1. Install Perl (and NASM is necessary)

 2. Make sure CMake, Perl, and NASM are all installed and available in whatever form that's feasible for the target platform.

 3. From the root of the OpenSSL source directory enter
    - `perl Configure CMake`

    The perl Configure script will produce `openssl-config.cmake` in the root OpenSSL source directory.

 4. You can now configure CMake in the root OpenSSL source directory using the CMakeLists.txt file.
 
 5. Additionally, you can embed OpenSSL directly into a custom CMake project by using `add_subdirectory(<OPENSSL_SOURCE_DIR> <OPENSSL_BINARY_DIR>)`, this even suppoort automatic perl configuration if the `OPENSSL_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS` CMake variable is set.

The CMake scripts produce a CMake target for each library that OpenSSL was configured for, they can be referenced in a CMake script using the aliased form `OpenSSL::<target>` or `openssl_<target>`, for example `OpenSSL::libcrypto` or `openssl_libcrypto`.

For the full installation instructions, or if anything goes wrong at any stage,
check the INSTALL.md file.

CMake Variables
---------------

    PERL_EXECUTABLE                     - The Perl executable path
    OPENSSL_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS           - Sets the options to configure with Perl, skips Perl configuration if unset

    OPENSSL_SRCDIR                      - The OpenSSL root source directory
    OPENSSL_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE   - Set when the target OS should produce PIC executables
    OPENSSL_LIBS                        - The CMake library targets
    OPENSSL_SHLIBS                      - The CMake shared library targets only
    OPENSSL_MODULES                     - The CMake module targets
    OPENSSL_PROGRAMS                    - The CMake application/program targets

    OPENSSL_STATIC_TARGETS              - The CMake static library targets

    OPENSSL_DSO_TARGETS                 - The CMake DSO/module targets
    OPENSSL_BIN_TARGETS                 - The CMake application/program targets

    OPENSSL_SOURCES_<target>            - The source files for a specific target
    OPENSSL_ASM_SOURCES_<target>        - The asm source files for a specific target
    OPENSSL_LINK_DEFS_<target>          - The linker defs files for a specific target
    OPENSSL_LINK_LIBRARIES_<target>     - The link libraries for a specific target
    OPENSSL_DEPENDENCIES_<target>       - The dependencies for a specific target

    openssl_docs - Generates the OpenSSL documenation and manuals


Installation directories
------------------------

Installation is not supported in the supplied CMake scripts yet, however you can set your own installation via your own custom CMake script and using `add_subdirectory(<OPENSSL_SOURCE_DIR> <OPENSSL_BINARY_DIR>)` and referencing the target you want to install, etc.
